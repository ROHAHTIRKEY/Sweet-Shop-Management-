Objective
The Sweet Shop is an e-commerce website that allows users to purchase a selection of confectionary items. The sweetshop was developed for my 5th portfolio project as part of my Diploma in software development.

About
The Sweet Shop website provides the user with the ability to purchase a wide variety of sweets. Upon landing on the site you are greeted with three main options which indicate the purpose of the site.

As a non-logged-in user, you can browse all the products and add them to your bag ready for checkout. You can then checkout by entering your details along with a valid card. Once your order is complete you will see a confirmation page and a confirmation email will be sent. As a logged-in user, you will be able to checkout faster as you can save your information to your profile. You will also be able to view your order history and leave reviews on your favourite products. A logged-in user will also be able to add their favourite sweets to their own page for quick and easy access for repeat purchases.

User Registration
An important aspect of the site was to give the user an option to purchase items from the site without having to sign up. Some users can find it frustrating being forced to sign up to a site before a purchase so I felt it was important to avoid this to limit any negative feedback on the site.
